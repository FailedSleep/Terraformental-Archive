# Terraformental

> Try to survive and perhaps eventually even tame an unknown planet in this incremental semi-idle game.
>
> Inspired by [Increlution](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593350/Increlution/), though if you've played that game, please be aware that the looping mechanic in this doesn't start unless/until you reach a certain point. So you do have to do some planning to make sure you survive long enough first time around.
